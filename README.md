# MKS22X-Knight

Can a knight, given a starting position on a board, have a series of moves so that it touches every square on the board exactly once?
The solve method answers that question, and the countSolutions method evaluates how many possible combinations of moves there are tha also solve the problem from that given spot.

Note: The optimization is not finished, I got all of the methods to work but I've been having trouble with the optimization part. Currently, only the array of moves for each space on the board is finished.
